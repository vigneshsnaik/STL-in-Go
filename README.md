# STL in Go

Hey there! Welcome to the **STL-in-Go** repo. This is my little corner of GitHub where I'm working on bringing some STL-inspired goodies to the Go programming language.

## What's This About?

I'm diving into creating some handy libraries for Go, inspired by the Standard Template Library (STL) you might know from C++. The idea is to build a set of tools and data structures that Go developers can use to make their lives easier.

## What to Expect

Right now, this repo is a clean slate. I'll be starting from scratch, focusing on building core data structures like:

- Vectors
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Maps
- Sets

It's all about bringing more versatility and convenience to Go development. If you're into that, keep an eye on this space!

## How to Get Started

Wanna check out the progress? Just clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigneshsnaik/STL-in-Go.git
cd STL-in-Go
```
